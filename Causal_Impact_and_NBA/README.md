**What a difference a James makes?**

We analyze the impact of LeBron James on the Cleveland Cavaliers (2014-2018) using a causal impact model. A Bayesian model is used to project what would have happened without his return, with figures likely contrasting the actual outcomes with these projections to show how much LeBron affected the team's performance.

_Model_

The data is divided into a "pre-intervention" period (2009-2014 Cleveland Cavaliers metrics - points scored, wins, plus-minus averaged monthly), which is used to fit the model, and a "post-intervention" period (2014-2018), where the model predicts what the team's performance would have been without LeBron's return. This allows for a clear comparison between the predicted and actual outcomes.

**Scoring Boost**: LeBron increased the Cavaliers' average monthly points by 9.7% (from 97.57 to 107.04 points).
**Winning Performance**: The team's win rate surged by 71.68%.
**Plus-Minus Statistic**: A significant shift in the team's plus-minus from an expected -3.04 to +3.91, emphasizing LeBron's influence on the teamâ€™s success.

... and notably, the Cavaliers secured their only championship title in 2016!
