In analyzing the passing schemes of both teams, the distinctive <b>horizontal</b> orientation of Spanish play reaffirms itself, contrasting sharply with the more traditional <b>vertical</b> patterns of Dutch football. Highlighted in these heatmaps, we observe the Spanish team's frequent passes across the field, emblematic of their expansive style of play. This approach mirrors the Barcelona-inspired tiki-taka philosophy, emphasizing ball possession and midfield domination, distinct from the elongated passing sequences<br>characteristic of Dutch football.
