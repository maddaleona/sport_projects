# Decoding Football Strategies Through Network Theory: Deconstructing Spain's Playbook in the FIFA WORLD CUPâ„¢ 2010 Final


In analyzing the passing schemes of both teams, the distinctive <b>horizontal</b> orientation of Spanish play reaffirms itself, contrasting sharply with the more traditional <b>vertical</b> patterns of Dutch football. Highlighted in these heatmaps, we observe the Spanish team's frequent passes across the field, emblematic of their expansive style of play. This approach mirrors the Barcelona-inspired tiki-taka philosophy, emphasizing ball possession and midfield domination, distinct from the elongated passing sequences characteristic of Dutch football. To be noticed also the huge difference in the number of passes between the two teams: Spain had control over the ball possession during the whole match.

A significant divergence between the teams emerges from analyzing the ball flow, measurable by <b>betweenness centrality</b>. The Dutch goalkeeper is crucial in influencing ball flow, comparable to his teammates, as seen in their vertical style. Conversely, Spanish defenders, midfielders, and forwards play pivotal roles in team flow, contrasting with Dutch players who circulate the ball with fewer passes. The ball flow is mainly controlled by the Spanish team, favored by the adopted strategy.
